This is the MPL branch of Flutter Sound. If you are developing a GPL App, you probably want to consider using
the [`GPL Ï„ Sound 9.0` fork](https://pub.dev/packages/tau_sound), because it has (or will have) several great enhancements :

- A new cleaner API
- Better Web Support
- A port to React Native (later)
- A port to Microsoft Blazor (later)
- A new class which will implement Audio Graphs (later)
- Better PCM support
- ... and soon perhaps other fantastic things ðŸ˜‰

## Overview

Flutter Sound is a Flutter package allowing you to play and record audio for :
- Android
- iOS
- Flutter Web

Flutter Sound provides both a high level API and widgets for:

* play audio
* record audio

Flutter Sound can be used to play a beep from an asset all the way up to implementing a complete media player.

This project is one of the two forks of the famous LGPL Flutter Sound Project 8.3. (The other being the GPL [Tau Sound Project 9.0](https://pub.dev/packages/tau_sound).

This fork is published under the Mozilla Public License MPL2.0. 

If your App will be covered by the GPL License,
you probably want to consider using the GPL [Tau Sound Project 9.0](https://pub.dev/packages/tau_sound) : Tau Sound 9.0 offers several enhancement compared to Flutter Sound 8.3.

## License

- Flutter Sound is copyrighted by Dooboolab (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021).
- Flutter Sound is released under the permissive Mozilla license which has a **weak** *copyleft* clause: if you modify some of Flutter Sound code you must publish your modifications under the MPL license too. But you may publish your App with any license you want. Even a Proprietary/Close Sources License (shame on you!).
- If your App is covered by the GPL license, you probably want to consider using the GPL [Tau Sound Project 9.0](https://pub.dev/packages/tau_sound) : indeed Tau Sound 9.0 offers several enhancement compared to Flutter Sound 8.3.
